#### LikeToKnow.it
I am currently Mobile Engineering Manager at LikeToKnow.it, an influencer shopping application that has over 2 million downloads and 60,000 5-star ratings. Our application has driven hundreds of millions of dollars in GMV for our retail partners. You can [read](https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/06/liketoknow-it-app-launch-screenshots/) more about the app, or [download](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1154027990) it.

#### Rollcall
The formative work of the LikeToKnow.it mobile app began with Rollcall, a startup I co-founded. We built the initial concept of matching screenshots through a client-side image analysis system written in Objective-C and C++. We also built a mobile native multi-retailer shopping cart system. Rollcall was funded by Accel, WME, Red Swan, and Social Starts.

#### Emojiyo
I designed and built this emoji focused keyboard to launch with the custom keyboards feature in iOS7. This keyboard offered emoji search, favorites, and saving combinations of emojis. Emojiyo was [featured](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jnrrog0Aa0s) on the Today Show.

#### Draw Something 2
I managed the mobile development team that built the sequel to Draw Something mobile at Zynga. This game had a cross platform C++ drawing engine, and native iOS and Android implementations of Instagram style social feeds for your drawings. A huge set of new drawing tools and game modes were offered.

#### Draw My Thing
At OMGPop, I built the original web based version of Draw Something that went on to be a huge mobile hit. Here is a video of a "youth" "casting" the game.
